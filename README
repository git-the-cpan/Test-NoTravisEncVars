NAME

    Test::NoTravisEncVars - Make sure "secret" Travis variables are not
    exposed.

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.001 of Test::NoTravisEncVars -
    released April 10, 2015 as part of Test-NoTravisEncVars.

SYNOPSIS

        # ...

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution currently provides no functionality.

    ...in here. Its tests, however, do fail if it's run on Travis and the
    decryption keys are available in the environment.

    That is, we're a sanity check. If our tests fail, our secrets may be
    breached. This is really only a concern if we're running third-party
    code; e.g. installing CPAN packages and having running their tests.
    It's possible that someone may write a test in such a way as to
    accidentally -- or deliberately -- make public the secrets guarding the
    encrypted data you've stashed in your project.
